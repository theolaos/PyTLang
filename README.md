# TLangPy

A pseudo-programming interpreted language created using Python. A fun little project.

To run a script written in tleng you need to type in the terminal

    --> python tlang1.py name_of_file.tlang
    
You can also put -log in the end to get a full traceback: WARNING -log is currently printing OLNY every assigned variable when it's assigned

    --> python tlang1.py name_of_file.tlang -log
    
--version : to get the version of the interpreter

--docs : to get the full documentation of the pseudo-programming language

--help : to get the this page


## DOCUMENTATION

Anything that isn't a scpecial keychar/keyword is considered a comment

`p()` is for printing anything put inside will be printed

    p(Hello World)

You can create variables using the `$` and name them whatever you want, the type of the variable will be assigned automativally

    $var_name = Hello World
    
There are four types of variables that the Language supports.

- Integer
- Float
- String
- Bool

## Contribution

WARNING: Code poorly optimized, and written like spaghetti. The reason is because this project was supposed to be small, but accidently made it bigger than envisioned, which led to me writing poor code due to the short time. Please understand if I fix any issues considering optimazation or readability is going to happen ONLY because I need the language for a particular use for another project.
